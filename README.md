## An Extended Mixed-Effects Modelling Framework for Meta-Analysis

The package consists of a collection of functions to perform various meta-analytical models within a unified mixed-effects framework, including standard univariate fixed and random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression, and non-standard extensions such as multivariate, multilevel, longitudinal, and dose-response models. The methodology is illustrated in detail in the article by Sera et al (see below).
